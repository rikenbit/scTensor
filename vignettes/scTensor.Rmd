# Introduction
## About Cell-Cell Interaction (CCI)

Due to the rapid development of single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) technologies,
wide variety of cell types such as multiple organs of a healthy person,
stem cell niche and cancer stem cell have been found.
Such complex systems are composed of communication between cells
(cell-cell interaction or CCI).

Many CCI studies are based on the ligand-receptor (L-R)-pair list of FANTOM5
project^[Jordan A. Ramilowski, A draft network of ligand-receptor-mediated multicellular signaling in human, Nature Communications, 2015]
as the evidence of CCI
(http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/suppl/Ramilowski_et_al_2015/data/PairsLigRec.txt).
The project proposed the L-R-candidate genes by following two reasons.

1. **Subcellular Localization**
    1. Known Annotation (UniProtKB and HPRD) : The term **"Secreted"** for
    candidate ligand genes and **"Plasma Membrane"** for
    candidate receptor genes
    2. Computational Prediction (LocTree3 and PolyPhobius)
2. **Physical Binding of Proteins** : Experimentally validated PPI
    (protein-protein interaction) information of HPRD and STRING

The project also merged the data with previous L-R database such as
IUPHAR/DLRP/HPMR and filter out the list without PMIDs.

Here, we extend a similar approach to the construction of the L-R-pair lists
of 12 organisms and implemented as multiple R/_Bioconductor_ annotation
packages for sustainable maintenance (`r Biocpkg("LRBaseDbi")` and
LRBase.XXX.eg.db-type packages (Figure 1).
XXX is the abbreviation of the scientific
name of organisms such as `r Biocpkg("LRBase.Hsa.eg.db")` for
L-R database of Homo sapiens.
Besides, we also developed `r Biocpkg("scTensor")`, which is a method to
detect CCI and the CCI-related L-R pairs simultaneously.
This document provides the way to use
`r Biocpkg("LRBaseDbi")`, LRBase.XXX.eg.db-type packages, and
`r CRANpkg("scTensor")` package.

![Figure 1 : Workflow of L-R-related packages](Workflow_2.png)

## Dependencies of CCI-related Packages

Our framework is composed of some annotation packages and software
packages (Figure 1).

`r Biocpkg("LRBaseDbi")` package defines the class "LRBaseDb" for
LRBase.XXX.eg.db-type packages such as `r Biocpkg("LRBase.Hsa.eg.db")` and unify
the object's behavior such as column function. `r CRANpkg("nnTensor")` which is
a CRAN package, performs non-negative tensor decomposition, and
`r Biocpkg("scTensor")` internally imports the nnTensor. `r CRANpkg("scTensor")`
constructs CCI-tensor from a LRBase.XXX.eg.db package and scRNA-Seq dataset,
decomposes to core tensor and factor matrices, and outputs HTML reports.
See the next usage section for the details.

# Usage
## LRBase.XXX.eg.db (ligand-receptor database of 12 organisms)

To create the L-R-list of 12 organisms, we used the information about the
subcellular localization of proteins from SWISSPROT (knowledge database) and
TREMBL (computational prediction). We also used the PPI information from the STRING
database  (Figure 1). The proteins which are assigned to the term **"Secreted"**
and **"Cellular Membrane"** are retrieved as candidate ligand and receptor,
respectively. Finally, the L-R-pairs which is registered in STRING is extracted
as candidate L-R-lists.

Following 12 organisms are implemented as LRBase.XXX.eg.db-type packages.

: (\#tab:table) The summary of 12 organisms of
LRBase$_\cdot$XXX$_\cdot$eg$_\cdot$db packages.

### columns, keytypes, keys, and select

Some data access functions are available for LRBase.XXX.eg.db-type packages.
Any data table are retrieved by 4 functions defined by
`r Biocpkg("AnnotationDbi")`; `columns`, `keytypes`, `keys`, and `select`
and commonly implemented by `r Biocpkg("LRBaseDbi")` package. `columns`
returns the rows which we can retrieve in LRBase.XXX.eg.db-type packages.
`keytypes` returns the rows which can be used as the optional parameter in
`keys` and select functions against LRBase.XXX.eg.db-type packages. `keys`
function returns the value of keytype. `select` function returns the rows in
particular columns, which are having user-specified keys. This function returns
the result as a dataframe. See the vignette of `r Biocpkg("AnnotationDbi")`
for more details.

```{r LRBase.XXX.eg.db, echo=FALSE}
if(!require(LRBase.Hsa.eg.db)){
    BiocManager::install("LRBase.Hsa.eg.db")
    suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(LRBase.Hsa.eg.db))
}
```

```{r LRBase.XXX.eg.db2, echo=TRUE}
columns(LRBase.Hsa.eg.db)
keytypes(LRBase.Hsa.eg.db)
key_HSA <- keys(LRBase.Hsa.eg.db, keytype="GENEID_L")
head(select(LRBase.Hsa.eg.db, keys=key_HSA[1:2],
            columns=c("GENEID_L", "GENEID_R"), keytype="GENEID_L"))
```

### Other functions

Other additional functions like `species`, `nomenclature`, and `listDatabases`
are available. In each LRBase.XXX.eg.db-type package, `species` function
returns the common name and `nomenclature` returns the scientific name.
`listDatabases` function returns the source of data. `dbInfo` returns the
information of the package. `dbfile` returns the directory where sqlite
file is stored. `dbschema` returns the schema of the database. `dbconn` returns
the connection to the sqlite database.

```{r LRBase.XXX.eg.db3, echo=TRUE}
lrPackageName(LRBase.Hsa.eg.db)
lrNomenclature(LRBase.Hsa.eg.db)
species(LRBase.Hsa.eg.db)
lrListDatabases(LRBase.Hsa.eg.db)
lrVersion(LRBase.Hsa.eg.db)

dbInfo(LRBase.Hsa.eg.db)
dbfile(LRBase.Hsa.eg.db)
dbschema(LRBase.Hsa.eg.db)
dbconn(LRBase.Hsa.eg.db)
```

Combined with `dbGetQuery` function of `r CRANpkg("RSQLite")` package,
more complicated queries also can be submitted.

```{r LRBase.XXX.eg.db4, echo=TRUE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("RSQLite"))
dbGetQuery(dbconn(LRBase.Hsa.eg.db),
  "SELECT * FROM DATA WHERE GENEID_L = '9068' AND GENEID_R = '14' LIMIT 10")
```

## LRBaseDbi (Class definition and meta-packaging)

`r Biocpkg("LRBaseDbi")` regulates the class definition of LRBaseDb object
instantiated from `LRBaseDb`-class. Besides, `r Biocpkg("LRBaseDbi")`
the package generates user's original LRBase.XXX.eg.db-type packages by
`makeLRBasePackage` function. This function is inspired by our previous package
`r Biocpkg("MeSHDbi")`, which constructs user's original MeSH.XXX.eg.db-type
packages. Here we call this function "meta"-packaging. The 12
LRBase.XXX.eg.db-type packages described above are also generated by this
"meta"-packaging. In this case, the only user have to specify are 1. an L-R-list
containing the columns "GENEID_L" (ligand NCBI Gene IDs) and "GENEID_R"
(receptor NCBI Gene IDs) and 2. a meta information table describing the L-R-list.
`makeLRBasePackage` function generates LRBase.XXX.eg.db like below. **The gene
identifier is limited as NCBI Gene ID for now.**

```{r LRBaseDbi, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("LRBaseDbi"))
```


```{r LRBaseDbi2, echo=TRUE}
example("makeLRBasePackage")
```

Although any package name is acceptable, note that if the organism that user
summarized L-R-list is also described above (Table \@ref(tab:table)), same
XXX-character is recommended. This is because of the HTML report function
described later identifies the XXX-character and if the XXX is corresponding to
the 12 organisms, the gene annotation of the generated HTML report will become rich.

## scTensor (CCI-tensor construction, decomposition, and HTML reporting)

Combined with LRBase.XXX.eg.db-type package and user's gene expression matrix
of scRNA-Seq, `r Biocpkg("scTensor")` detects CCIs and generates HTML reports
for exploratory data inspection. The algorithm of `r Biocpkg("scTensor")`
is as follows.

Firstly, `r Biocpkg("scTensor")` calculates the celltype-level mean vectors,
searches the corresponding pair of genes in the row names of the matrix,
and extracted as tow vectors.

Next, the cell type-level mean vectors of ligand expression and that of receptor
expression are multiplied as outer product and converted to cell type $\times$
cell type matrix. Here, the multiple matrices can be represented as a three-order
"tensor" (Ligand-Cell * Receptor-Cell * L-R-Pair). `r Biocpkg("scTensor")`
decomposes the tensor into a small tensor (core tensor) and two factor
matrices. Tensor decomposition is very similar to the matrix decomposition like
PCA (principal component analysis). The core tensor is similar to the eigenvalue of
PCA;  this means that how much the pattern is outstanding. Likewise, three
matrices are similar to the PC scores/loadings of PCA; These represent which
ligand-cell/receptor-cell/L-R-pair are informative. When the matrices have
negative values, interpreting which direction (+/-) is important and which
is not, is a difficult and laboring task. That's why, `r Biocpkg("scTensor")`
performs non-negative Tucker2 decomposition (NTD2), which is non-negative version
of tensor decomposition (cf. `r CRANpkg("nnTensor")`).

Finally, the result of NTD2 is summarized as an HTML report. Because most of the plots
are visualized by `r CRANpkg("plotly")` package, the precise information of
the plot can be interactively confirmed by user's on-site web browser.
The two factor matrices can be interactively viewed and which cell types
and which L-R-pairs are likely to be interacted each other.
The mode-3 (LR-pair direction) sum of the core tensor is calculated and
visualized as Ligand-Receptor Patterns. Detail of
(Ligand-Cell, Receptor-Cell, L-R-pair) Patterns are also visualized.



### Creating a `SingleCellExperiment` object

Here, we use the scRNA-Seq dataset of male germline cells and somatic cells$^{3}$
[GSE86146](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE86146)
as demo data. For saving the package size,
the number of genes is strictly reduced by the standard of highly variable
genes with a threshold of the p-value are 1E-150
(cf. [Identifying highly variable genes](http://pklab.med.harvard.edu/scw2014/subpop_tutorial.html)).
That's why we won't argue about the scientific discussion of the data here.

We assume that user has a scRNA-Seq data matrix containing expression count
data summarised at the level of the gene. First, we create a
`r Biocpkg("SingleCellExperiment")` object containing the data.
The rows of the object correspond to features, and the columns
correspond to cells. The gene identifier is limited as NCBI Gene ID for now.

To improve the interpretability of the following HTML report, we highly recommend
that user specifies the two-dimensional data of input data
(e.g. PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP). Such information is easily specified by
`reducedDims` function of `r Biocpkg("SingleCellExperiment")` package and is
saved to reducedDims slot of `SingleCellExperiment` object
(Figure \@ref(fig:cellCellSetting)).

```{r scTensor, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("scTensor"))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("SingleCellExperiment"))
```


```{r cellCellSetting, fig.cap="Germline, Male, GSE86146", echo=TRUE, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
data(GermMale)
data(labelGermMale)
data(tsneGermMale)

sce <- SingleCellExperiment(assays=list(counts = GermMale))
reducedDims(sce) <- SimpleList(TSNE=tsneGermMale$Y)
plot(reducedDims(sce)[[1]], col=labelGermMale, pch=16, cex=2,
  xlab="Dim1", ylab="Dim2", main="Germline, Male, GSE86146")
legend("topleft", legend=c(paste0("FGC_", 1:3), paste0("Soma_", 1:4)),
  col=c("#9E0142", "#D53E4F", "#F46D43", "#ABDDA4", "#66C2A5", "#3288BD", "#5E4FA2"),
  pch=16)
```

Note that if you want to use scTensor framework against other species such as
mouse or rat, load corresponding LRBase.XXX.eg.db and MeSH.XXX.eg.db packages.

For example, if your scRNA-Seq dataset is sampled from Mouse, load
`r Biocpkg("LRBase.Mmu.eg.db")` and `r Biocpkg("MeSH.Mmu.eg.db")`
instead of `r Biocpkg("LRBase.Hsa.eg.db")` and `r Biocpkg("MeSH.Hsa.eg.db")`.

```{r scTensor2, echo=FALSE}
if(!require(LRBase.Mmu.eg.db)){
    BiocManager::install("LRBase.Mmu.eg.db")
    suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(LRBase.Mmu.eg.db))
}
```

### Parameter setting : cellCellSetting

To perform the tensor decomposition and HTML report, user is supposed to
specify

- 1. LRBase.XXX.eg.db
- 2. color vector of each cell
- 3. cell type vector of each cell

to `SingleCellExperiment` object. The corresponding information
is registered to the metadata slot of `SingleCellExperiment` object by
`cellCellSetting` function.

```{r cellCellDecomp2, echo=TRUE}
cellCellSetting(sce, LRBase.Hsa.eg.db, names(labelGermMale))
```

### CCI-tensor construction and decomposition : cellCellDecomp

After `cellCellSetting`, we can perform tensor decomposition by
`cellCellDecomp`. Here the parameter `ranks` is specified as dimension of
core tensor. For example, c(2, 3) means The data tensor is decomposed to
2 ligand-patterns and 3 receptor-patterns.

```{r cellCellDecomp, echo=TRUE}
set.seed(1234)
cellCellDecomp(sce, ranks=c(2,3))
```

Although user has to specify the rank to perform cellCellDecomp,
we implemented a simple rank estimation function based on the eigenvalues
distribution of PCA in the matricised tensor in each mode in `cellCellRank`.
rks$selected is also specified as rank parameter of `cellCellDecomp`.

```{r cellCellRank, echo=TRUE}
(rks <- cellCellRanks(sce))
rks$selected
```

### HTML Report : cellCellReport

If `cellCellDecomp` is properly finished, we can perform `cellCellReport`
function to output the HTML report like below. Please type
`example(cellCellReport)` and the report will be generated in the temporary
directory (it costs 5 to 10 minutes).
After `cellCellReport`, multiple R markdown files, compiled HTML files,
figures, and R binary file containing the result of analysis are saved to
`out.dir` (Figure 2). For more details, open the `index.html` by your web
browser. Combined with cloud storage service such as Amazon Simple Storage
Service (S3), it can be a simple web application and multiple people like
collaborators can confirm the same report simultaneously.

# Session information {.unnumbered}

```{r sessionInfo, echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```
