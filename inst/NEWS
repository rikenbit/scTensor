VERSION 2.4.1
------------------------
   o A vignette modified.

VERSION 2.4.0
------------------------
   o Regularizer parameter (L2_A/L1_A) was added in cellCellDecomp() ("ntd", "ntd2").
   o Multilinear CX Decompotision was added in cellCellDecomp() ("cx").
   o convertNCBIGeneID is removed.
   o The vignettes were modified.
   o Support of LRBase.XXX.eg.db-type packages is completely deprecated

VERSION 2.0.0
------------------------
   o Extended to use the version 2.0.0 of LRBase.XXX.eg.db-type packages
   o Omitted typing Enter-key many times to perform example('cellCellReport')
   o lr.evidence option was added in cellCellRanks() and cellCellDecomp() to select ligand-receptor databases to construct CCI-tensor (cf. Evidence code: https://github.com/rikenbit/lrbase-workflow)
   o The L-R evidence was embeded in the HTML report.
   o The bug related to the hyper-link was fixed in .hyperLinks.
   o Auto library installation/loading for MeSH.XXX.eg.db. Note that this function is based on the NCBI Taxonomy ID embedded in METATDATA table in the sqlite3 file of LRBase.XXX.eg.db.
   o The order of the parameters of cellCellSetting were changed as cellCellSetting(sce, lrbase, label, lr.evidence="all", color=NULL), and color parameter was changed as a optional parameter. If it is not specified, the color is automatically selected.
   o The way to specify the celltype label was changed in cellCellSetting.
   o The vignettes were modified.
   o The convertNCBIGeneID is deprecated. The same functionality can be available as scTGIF::convertRowID instead.
